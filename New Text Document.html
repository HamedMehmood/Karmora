  <li>You must be a Karmora member to participate. Everyone who is anyone is a Karmora member! </li>
  <li> If using Instagram, make sure your profile is viewable to the public and/or we are connected. Ya know, you like us, we like you, so we follow each other. We can’t guarantee we won’t comment on all your selfies though!</li>
  <li> Don’t procrastinate! This isn't homework or doing the dishes! The sooner you submit your photo the more time you have to gain votes. We will not accept votes or photos after October 31, 2014 at 11:59:59 PM AZ Time.</li>
  <li> Only photos containing funny, hilarious, crazy, entertaining, interesting, creative, or otherwise awesome pictures of Kevin will be accepted for voting. Once accepted you will receive an email with your very own voting page to send to your peeps so they can hook you up with some righteous votes!</li>
  <li> This is a PG Rated promotion. Photos containing naughty stuff like nudity, or illegal activity will be destroyed!</li>
  <li> Be shameless! Invite everyone you know to vote for your photo everyday. The top three photos with the most votes will be awarded 1st, 2nd and 3rd prize. You and your righteous peeps are limited to one vote per IP address per day.</li>
  <li> Be more than shameless and invite your friends to join your Karmora Community and receive 10 votes for every person that joins.</li>
  <li> Prize amounts will be added to your Karmora eWallet and will be immediately available to be cashed out!</li>
  <li> Cheaters Never Win! If you are caught cheating for votes we will disqualify you and chant “cheater, cheater, cheater!”</li>
  <li> In the event of a tie, Karmora staff in their unquestionable, undeniable, remarkable, just, fair and sole discretion will determine placement.</li>
  <li> Be a horrible winner and brag as much as possible to everyone you know (and don’t know) about winning the promotion and how smart, funny and creative your are. And... after you catch your breath and your arm stops cramping from patting yourself on the back, invite them to join your Karmora Shopping Community!</li>
  <li> Don’t be a cry baby if you lose. No one likes a cry baby! Besides, this promotion is bound by our membership Terms of Use which strictly prohibits crying. Seriously, we’re not kidding. Well... kinda.</li>
  <li> Winners will be announced on November 1, 2014.</li>
